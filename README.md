Why CANcrusher? 
As an embedded engineer in the automotive world, I've used the high $$$$ systems and they're great! But they're expensive... There were times that I wanted to have a low-cost system that I could code myself and was inexpensive enough that I could leave in a customer's trunk to monitor my product and report in wirelessly without worrying about ever getting it back. I can't do that with a commercial device that costs $5k-$10k. My goal is to get as many of these built and out to other automotive and hacking enthusiasts as possible in the hopes that the firmware base and the support tools can approach the same usefulness and quality as the closed source commercial tools.
